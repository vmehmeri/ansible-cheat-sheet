# ansible-cheat-sheet
This is a Cheat Sheet for Ansible Playbook developers, written as playbook.
To run the playbook and test all the commands in it, run from a Linux machine with Ansible (2.4 or greater) installed:

$ ansible-playbook ansible-cheat-sheet-playbook.yml

No need to specify inventory as the target host is localhost (no change is performed, only log messages are output).
